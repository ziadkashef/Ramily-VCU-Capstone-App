# *CS25-337 Project Description*
Freshmen and transfer students are seeking a deeper sense of belonging and community, as well as better connection to opportunities available during their time at VCU. Students shared that they felt overwhelmed having to figure out their academic, professional, and social lives all at once, especially in their first year at VCU. Students said that they also felt overwhelmed by the number of resources on campus. For example, students named 22 mobile apps that they had downloaded and used as they were trying to settle into life at VCU. da Vinci student teams proposed a homegrown, VCU mobile app that integrates key features from VCU Mobile (e.g., class schedule) and RamsConnect (e.g., student groups), and newly designed features aimed at enhancing students’ sense of belonging at VCU. The ultimate impact being facilitating a deeper connection between students & campus environment, improved mental health & student academic success, and improved student retention.

## *Short Project Description*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project follows a standard Flutter app structure with several key directories:

-   `/lib`: Contains all Dart code for the application
    -   `/Screens`: UI screens of the application
    -   `/services`: Business logic and services
    -   `/models`: Data models

### Key Files

-   `main.dart`: Entry point of the application
-   `firebase_options.dart`: Firebase configuration
-   `constants.dart`: App-wide constants including VCU brand colors
-   `matching_screen.dart`: Matching feature implementation
-   `traditions_screen.dart`: Traditions feature implementation
-   `chat_screen.dart` & `chat_detail_screen.dart`: Messaging functionality
-   `profile_creation_screen.dart`: User onboarding and profile setup
-   `profile_editor.dart`: Profile editing functionality

Key Features
------------

### User Authentication

RAMily uses Firebase Authentication to manage its users securely. Users create accounts with their email and a profile with their:

-   Name
-   Major
-   Pronouns
-   Interests (5 required)
-   Bio (using prompt-based system)

### Matching System

The custom matching algorithm considers:

-   Academic focus (major proximity using category-based scoring)
-   Personal interests (with bonuses for multiple shared interests)
-   Bio keyword compatibility
-   Pronouns compatibility
-   User-adjustable weighting between academic and social factors

Users can adjust the priority between academic and social matching using an intuitive slider interface that ranges from 30-70% in either direction.

### Traditions Feature

The traditions system encourages campus exploration through:

-   Location-based verification (±8m accuracy) of campus landmarks
-   Points system with varied values for different locations
-   Progress visualization with circular indicator
-   Special handling for seasonal events
-   Rewards for completing all non-seasonal traditions
-   Gamification elements to increase engagement

### Messaging

RAMily includes a real-time messaging system that:

-   Requires mutual connection acceptance
-   Provides unread message indicators
-   Shows delivery/read status
-   Includes message request management with approve/decline options
-   Supports reporting functionality

### Rambassadors Program

A key future feature that connects new students with upperclassmen mentors:

-   Personalized guidance for incoming freshmen and transfer students
-   Campus resource navigation assistance
-   Peer-to-peer support during transition to university life
-   Mentor matching based on academic pathways and interests
-   Schedule check-ins and progress tracking

### App Consolidation

RAMily aims to reduce "app fatigue" by integrating multiple VCU services into one platform:

-   Combines features from VCU Mobile and RamsConnect
-   Centralizes access to student groups, academic resources, and events
-   Streamlines student experience through unified interface
-   Reduces the need for multiple app downloads (students reported using up to 22 different apps)

Technical Implementation
------------------------

### Frontend

-   **Framework**: Flutter/Dart
-   **State Management**: Combination of StatefulWidget and Provider pattern
-   **UI Components**: Custom widgets built with Material Design following VCU branding
-   **Navigation**: Custom navigator implementation with TabController

### Backend

-   **Database**: Firebase Firestore
-   **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with custom JWT implementation
-   **Real-time Data**: Firebase Realtime Database
-   **Storage**: Local storage for profile images with path references in Firestore

### Key Algorithms

-   **Matching Algorithm**: The app uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system:
    -   Major proximity (1.0 for same major, 0.67 for same subcategory, 0.33 for same category)
    -   Interest overlap with bonuses for multiple shared interests
    -   Bio keyword compatibility based on common terms
    -   Small bonus for compatible pronouns
    -   User-controlled weighting using majorMultiplier value
    -   Final score curve applied for better distribution

Firebase Configuration
----------------------

### Setup Firebase Project

1.  Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2.  Create a new project named "RAMily"
3.  Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password)
4.  Create a Firestore Database in production mode with appropriate rules
5.  Set up Firebase Realtime Database for chat functionality

### Database Structure

Key collections in Firestore:

-   `users`: User profiles and preferences
-   `chats`: Chat room metadata
-   `users/{userId}/user_chats`: Active chats for a user
-   `users/{userId}/message_requests`: Pending chat requests
-   `chats/{chatId}/messages`: Individual messages in a chat

### Connect Flutter App to Firebase

1.  Install the Firebase CLI:

    bash

    ```
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2.  Login to Firebase:

    bash

    ```
    firebase login
    ```

3.  Configure Firebase for Flutter:

    bash

    ```
    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
    flutterfire configure --project=your-firebase-project-id
    ```

4.  This will generate the necessary `firebase_options.dart` file
5.  Download the google-services.json file and place it in:

    ```
    android/app/google-services.json
    ```

6.  Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file and place it in:

    ```
    ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
    ```

7.  Ensure your firebase_options.dart file is correctly configured
